life lasts only a certin length of time. although we dont know an end date there still is an end to our lives eventually. everything you do costs you time off your life. like that choclate bar for $2 plus the time to go get it and fuel for the drive may have been a total of $5 but it really was closer to an hour of your life. you will never get that back. 
The truth is that no one else can define what that time is worth to you. usually when your younger it wont be much but as you age and start really looking at everything you do then time could be more valueable then money. take what you get paid per hour and when you do or pay for anything convert that to a cost in time off your life. now i bet that that choclate bar wouldnt seem worth it.
i would rather have an hour with my kids or parents talking or visiting than a choclate bar.imagine if you had 100 choclate bars through your life at a cost of 1 hour each. what could you have done with 100 hours of time.you could change the whole outcome of your life with that. but even when people are forced to see this kind of stuff it may alarm them for a few minutes but most will not make a single change or ever think about it again.
but its hard for a sheep to stand there alone and be different when there are 9 billion other sheep being the same. A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.
